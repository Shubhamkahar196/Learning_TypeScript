//tuples = fixed number


// In TypeScript, tuples are a type of array that has a fixed number of elements, and each element can have a different type. Tuples allow you to express an array with a fixed number of elements of specific types.

// Tuple Syntax:


// let tupleName: [type1, type2, type3, ...];



let person: [string, number];
person = ["John", 30];


// In this example, person is a tuple with two elements: a string and a number.

// Key Features:

// 1. Fixed Length: Tuples have a fixed number of elements.
// 2. Specific Types: Each element in a tuple can have a different type.
// 3. Order Matters: The order of elements in a tuple matters.

let arrr: [string,number] = ["sk", 22];
